# Build, test and publish the TypeScript (ts/) implementation, and

# The aggregate targets (build/test/clean) stay ts-only so they never

# Go releases are `go/v*` tags served by the module proxy (see
# .github/workflows), so publish-go stays an echo.
#
# Local build/test resolve the unpublished @tabnas siblings via the
# repo-set node_modules symlinks (admin/scripts/link.sh).
