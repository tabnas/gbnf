# CROSS-COMPILING USES ZIG. The library needs cgo, and cgo needs a C
# toolchain per target — which is what normally forces a CI matrix of
# native runners. `zig cc` is a cross compiler for all of them, so one
# Linux box can produce Linux and Windows artifacts. Point ZIG at the
# binary, or have it on PATH:
#
#   curl -L https://ziglang.org/download/<ver>/zig-<host>-<ver>.tar.xz | tar xJ
#   ZIG=./zig-<host>-<ver>/zig ./build.sh all
#
# macOS is the exception and cannot be cross-compiled this way: linking
# needs Apple's SDK (CoreFoundation, libresolv), which zig cannot
# redistribute. Build darwin artifacts on a macOS host, where the plain
# system toolchain works and ZIG is not needed.
