# leaving the committed lock stale -- cargo then regenerates it in the
# runner and everything goes green.
#
# So the whole resolution is compared, before and after cargo runs, with one
# exemption per path dependency: the sibling crate's recorded version. That
# entry legitimately moves whenever the sibling checkout does, and exempting
# exactly those is what makes a full comparison usable here when blanket

# checkouts: an unformatted file over there fails this gate even when
# every file here is clean.
