// The render, run: a grammar spec written as GBNF by the render the
// package carries (`translate().render`), through the `alchemy` command
// (tabnas/alchemy-cli), which this package does not depend on. Set
// TABNAS_ALCHEMY to the command's path to run these tests; without it
// they skip.
//
// Each spec is one the compiler writes, changed where a test says, so
// what the render reads is a tree a host can hand it. The render writes
// what GBNF can say, and the text compiles back to the spec it was
// written from; the rest it refuses with TARGET_VALUE_UNREPRESENTABLE,
// naming what, and never writes a grammar that recognises another
